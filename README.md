# Class-Collab-Challenge-1
Our first assignment to practice using our collaboration tools: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation


Step 1. One person from each group will create a new branch for your group to work on. In your terminal, use the command: git branch nameofBranch. (Replace nameofBranch with a unique group name). 
    -Each member will then switch their branch to match the 'new' branch. (read more https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) 
Step 2. Each group member will add their name to the text file in this format: 'real name - githubusername' 
Step 3. Each student will then take turns to commit, and push their changes to their group branch one by one.
Step 4.  Once the text file contains everyoneâ€™s names, one person from each group will make a pull request to the main branch. You may alert Ms Ramirez that your group is done. 


The GroupMembers.txt file in each folder will be combined for a full class roster used by Ms Ramirez to grade your future github assignments.
